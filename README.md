## Instructions

At first glance it seems that the program does not do anything, however it is waiting for the user to write the hour and then the exact minute.

Example:
In the first line represents the hour: 06
In the second line represents the exact minute: 02

In this case we are telling the computer to turn off at that exact time

Once we have finished specifying the time, it will detect which operating system we are running. and at that time the machine will turn off.
